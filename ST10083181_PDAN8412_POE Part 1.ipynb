    "# What is a recurrent neural network?\n",
    "-\tAccording to Awan. A (2022), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a specialized type of artificial neural network (ANN) designed to process and analyse sequential data. RNNs excel in tasks like voice recognition in Apple’s Siri and Google’s voice search by leveraging an internal memory that enables them to remember and utilize previous inputs. This memory function is what distinguishes RNNs from traditional neural networks, where each input is treated independently. The ability of RNNs to maintain context over time makes them particularly effective for applications involving time series prediction, text generation, transcription, and machine translation, where the sequence of data points is crucial for accurate prediction or classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tAwan. A (2022), states that RNNs work by introducing a loop within the network structure that allows information to be passed from one step of the sequence to the next, creating a \"memory\" of previous inputs. Unlike feedforward neural networks, where inputs and outputs are treated independently, RNNs take into account the sequence of inputs. The hidden layer in an RNN functions as this memory, capturing information from all previous time steps. During processing, the network updates the hidden state with each new input, ensuring that the sequence's context is preserved. This allows the network to make predictions or classifications that depend on prior elements in the sequence. The training process in RNNs utilizes a specialized form of backpropagation called backpropagation through time (BPTT), which sums errors across time steps to adjust weights and biases appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tRNNs are versatile in their application due to the different lengths of inputs and outputs they can handle. The types of RNNs According to Awan. A (2022), include:\n",
    "1.\tOne-to-One: This is the simplest form of RNN, used for problems where there is a single input and a single output, similar to traditional neural networks.\n",
    "2.\tOne-to-Many: This type takes a single input and produces multiple outputs. It is often used in tasks like image captioning, where a single image is the input, and a sequence of words (a caption) is the output.\n",
    "3.\tMany-to-One: This type processes a sequence of inputs to produce a single output. A common application is sentiment analysis, where the input is a sequence of words (text), and the output is a sentiment category.\n",
    "4.\tMany-to-Many: This type handles sequences as both input and output, making it ideal for tasks like machine translation, where a sentence in one language is translated into a sentence in another language.\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tThe structure of an RNN is designed to incorporate sequential memory by introducing loops that allow information to persist within the network. Unlike traditional feedforward networks, which have a linear flow of data from input to output, RNNs feature a looping mechanism that acts as a conduit for information to flow from one time step to the next. This mechanism enables the hidden state to function as the network's memory, capturing and retaining information from all previous time steps. During processing, each word or data point is transformed into a machine-readable vector, and the RNN processes these vectors sequentially. The hidden state is updated continuously, combining the current input with the previous hidden state to form a new vector. This vector is passed through an activation function like tanh, which ensures that the values remain within a certain range, preventing the outputs from exploding or vanishing. This process allows RNNs to maintain a memory of prior inputs while processing new data, making them capable of handling sequential information effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tAccording to Anon (2024), RNNs are based on the recursive application of a function to a sequence of inputs. Mathematically, the hidden state ℎ𝑡 at time step 𝑡 is defined as ℎ𝑡=𝑓(𝑊ℎℎ𝑡−1+𝑊𝑥𝑥𝑡+𝑏), where 𝑊ℎ and 𝑊𝑥 are weight matrices for the hidden state and the input, respectively, 𝑏 is the bias, and 𝑓 is an activation function (often tanh or ReLU). The output 𝑦𝑡 is typically calculated as 𝑦𝑡=𝑔(𝑊𝑦ℎ𝑡+𝑐) where, 𝑊𝑦 is the weight matrix for the output and 𝑐 is the bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "-\tAccording to Anon (2024), Training RNNs involves Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT), a specialized form of backpropagation that accounts for errors across all time steps. This process can be computationally intensive due to the need to unroll the network and compute gradients for each time step. Challenges such as vanishing and exploding gradients can arise, which can be mitigated using techniques like gradient clipping and advanced architectures like LSTM and GRU.\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tAnon (2024), states that to reduce the computational load, a variant called Truncated BPTT is often used, where the sequence is split into smaller chunks, and backpropagation is applied only over these chunks rather than the entire sequence. This reduces the memory requirement and speeds up training, albeit at the cost of potentially losing some long-term dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tAnon (2024), states that to prevent overfitting, regularization techniques such as dropout (applied between RNN layers) are used during training. Dropout randomly disables a fraction of the neurons during each training iteration, which helps to prevent the network from becoming too dependent on specific neurons and thus improves generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tAccording to Awan. A (2022) RNNs offer several advantages, particularly in handling sequential data where the order of inputs is critical. However, they also come with notable limitations. One major challenge is the vanishing gradient problem, where the gradients used to update the network’s weights become so small that learning effectively stops, leading to poor performance in long sequences. Conversely, the exploding gradient problem occurs when gradients become too large, causing instability in the model. These issues can be mitigated with advanced architectures like LSTM and GRU, which are designed to handle long-term dependencies and maintain stable learning over time. Despite these challenges, RNNs remain a powerful tool for tasks that require an understanding of sequential patterns, offering unique advantages in fields such as natural language processing, time series forecasting, and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tTo address some of the inherent limitations of standard RNNs, advanced architectures such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) were developed. According to Awan. A (2022), These architectures introduce gating mechanisms that regulate the flow of information through the network, allowing it to retain relevant information over longer periods and discard irrelevant data. LSTMs, for instance, have a more complex structure with multiple interacting layers that work together to maintain long-term dependencies within the sequence. GRUs, while simpler in structure, achieve similar results by using update and reset gates to control the hidden state. These advanced architectures are particularly useful in tasks that require the network to remember information from far back in the sequence, such as speech recognition, text generation, and machine translation.\n",

    "# Why is the chosen dataset appropriate for analysis with an RNN?\n",
    "- This dataset comprises 100,000 reviews of the ChatGPT app, sourced from the Google Play Store. It includes diverse feedback from users in ten countries, offering valuable insights into user experiences and app performance. The dataset is ideal for natural language processing tasks, sentiment analysis, and user feedback studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sequential Nature of Review Text:\n",
    "-\tRNNs are specifically designed to process sequential data by maintaining a hidden state that evolves over time. This ability to capture temporal dependencies makes RNNs ideal for analysing text where the sequence of words impacts the meaning. According to Awan, A (2022), RNNs use loops to pass information from one time step to the next, making them well-suited for tasks like sentiment analysis and text classification, which are central to this ChatGPT reviews dataset. The dataset includes comments, which are sequential in nature. Each review is a sequence of words where the order of words is crucial for understanding the sentiment and context. The ‘comment’ feature contains strings of varying lengths, each representing a sequence of words. A comment may change its meaning entirely based on word order, making RNNs particularly well-suited for this type of sequential processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Handling Long-Term Dependencies:\n",
    "-\tRNNs, and more advanced variants like LSTM and GRU, can maintain and utilize contextual information across long sequences. LSTMs, for example, use gating mechanisms to manage long-term dependencies and retain relevant information, addressing the issue of vanishing gradients as highlighted by Hochreiter, S and Schmidhuber, J (1997). This capability is crucial for accurately interpreting user reviews where context plays a significant role. Comments on a review often involve nuanced opinions and feedback that are dependent on the context of preceding words. LSTMs are specifically designed to manage the issue of vanishing gradients, allowing them to retain important information over longer sequences of text. This capability is essential for processing lengthy reviews in the ChatGPT dataset, where key sentiment cues might appear early on and must be retained through the end of the review.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handling Variable-Length Sequences:\n",
    "-\tRNNs process sequences iteratively, which allows them to handle varying lengths of input data. This flexibility is a key advantage of RNNs over traditional neural networks that often require fixed-size inputs. This adaptability is emphasized in sequence modelling research, such as that by Bengio, Y, Simard, P et al, (1994), which demonstrates how RNNs can manage sequences of arbitrary lengths. The length of reviews in this dataset varies widely, from short comments to detailed feedback. RNNs are capable of handling inputs of variable lengths without requiring a fixed size, making them suitable for this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT):\n",
    "- BPTT is designed to handle the unique challenges of sequential data by calculating gradients across all time steps. This approach allows RNNs to learn from the context provided by the entire sequence, addressing the temporal dependencies in reviews in the dataset. As discussed by Hinton, G. et al. (1986), BPTT enables the RNN to adjust weights based on accumulated errors over time, enhancing its ability to process and understand complex sequences. Training the RNN to understand and generate text involves using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT), a specialized training method for sequential data. This method helps in learning from the entire sequence of words in each review. In the ChatGPT Reviews dataset, BPTT enables the model to effectively process and understand complex sentences by adjusting weights based on accumulated errors across the sequence. This is particularly important for understanding the nuances in user reviews where the sentiment or meaning may depend on multiple words spread across a long text.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Sentiment Prediction and Label Mapping:\n",
    "- RNNs are highly effective at mapping sequences of text to corresponding labels, a process crucial for tasks like sentiment analysis or predicting ratings. According to Sutskever, I. et al. (2014), sequence-to-sequence models built on RNNs can be used for predictive tasks involving sequential data. This functionality makes RNNs an ideal choice for analysing user feedback in this dataset, where the goal is to predict or classify user sentiment based on review text. In the ChatGPT dataset, where reviews are paired with ratings and thumbs up/down counts, RNNs can learn to predict the overall sentiment or rating based on the review's textual content or comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Integration with Categorical Data:\n",
    "- RNNs can be integrated with other types of data (e.g., categorical variables) by combining them in a hybrid model. This approach leverages the sequential processing capabilities of RNNs along with other feature inputs to improve overall model performance. This integration is supported by advancements in hybrid neural network architectures that combine sequential and non-sequential data (Zhang, X. et al., 2016). Beyond textual data, the dataset also includes categorical variables like app version, country, and rating. This integration allows for a more robust model capable of making nuanced predictions based on a combination of textual and non-textual data.\n",

    "## 6. Interpreting Model Results: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Interpreting Performance Scores\n",
    "-\tAccuracy: Measures the proportion of correctly classified instances among the total instances. High accuracy indicates that the model is correctly predicting a large portion of the reviews. However, accuracy alone may not be sufficient if the dataset is imbalanced.\n",
    "-\tPrecision: The ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives. High precision indicates that when the model predicts a positive class, it is correct most of the time.\n",

    "-\tFalse Positives (FP): Negative reviews incorrectly predicted as positive.\n",
    "-\tFalse Negatives (FN): Positive reviews incorrectly predicted as negative.\n",
    "-    From the confusion matrix, we can derive:\n",
    "     -\tClass Imbalance: If the matrix shows that some classes have many more instances than others, the model might be biased towards the majority class. This can be addressed by techniques such as resampling or adjusting class weights.\n",
    "     -\tError Types: Identify which types of errors are most common (e.g., the model frequently misclassifies positive reviews as negative). This helps in understanding where the model’s predictions are falling short and guides potential improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Effects of Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "-\tImpact on Performance Metrics: After tuning hyperparameters, compare the performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) with those obtained before tuning. Improved scores indicate successful tuning. For example:\n",
    "-\tLearning Rate: A well-tuned learning rate should lead to faster convergence and better accuracy. Too high a rate might result in unstable training, while too low might slow down convergence.\n",
    "-\tNumber of LSTM Units/Layers: Increasing units or layers can capture more complex patterns but may lead to overfitting if not properly regularized.\n",
    "-\tDropout Rate: Adjusting the dropout rate can help mitigate overfitting. A high dropout rate might improve generalization but could also lead to underfitting if too much information is discarded.\n",
    "-\tVisualization of Tuning Effects: Plot learning curves (training and validation loss/accuracy) for different hyperparameter settings to visually assess improvements and identify overfitting or underfitting issues.\n",

    "  - Split the sampled data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using `randomSplit()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset Class Definition:**\n",
    "  - Created a custom PyTorch Dataset class to handle sparse features and labels, implementing methods such as `__len__()` and `__getitem__()` to return the number of samples and specific samples, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collate Function:**\n",
    "  - Defined a custom `collate_fn` function to handle batch processing of sparse features, converting sparse tensors to dense format if necessary and ensuring compatibility with PyTorch's DataLoader.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DataLoader Creation:**\n",
    "  - Created DataLoader instances for training and testing data using `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`, specifying batch size and `collate_fn` to manage batching and data preparation efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Model Definition and Training\n",
    "- **Model Definition:**\n",
    "  - Defined RNN and LSTM models with configurable hyperparameters such as hidden size, number of layers, learning rate, and dropout rate using `torch.nn.Module` subclasses.\n",
    "  - Implemented RNN and LSTM layers using `torch.nn.RNN` and `torch.nn.LSTM`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**\n",
    "  - Defined a hyperparameter space including hidden sizes, number of layers, learning rates, and dropout rates.\n",
    "  - Used random search to sample and test 5 different hyperparameter combinations to identify the best-performing configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training Function:**\n",
    "  - Implemented a training function with early stopping to prevent overfitting, iterating over epochs, updating model parameters using `optimizer.step()`, and computing loss with `criterion`.\n",
    "  - Trained both RNN and LSTM models on the training data and evaluated performance on the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaluation Function:**\n",
    "  - Evaluated model performance using accuracy score on the test set, calculating the proportion of correct predictions to the total number of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Early Stopping:**\n",
    "  - Implemented early stopping by monitoring validation loss and halting training if no improvement was observed for a specified number of epochs to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Results and Model Selection\n",
    "- **Random Search for Hyperparameter Tuning:**\n",
    "  - Tested different hyperparameter combinations using random search to find the best-performing model based on accuracy metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Selection:**\n",
    "  - Identified the best model and hyperparameters based on the highest accuracy achieved during testing, selecting the configuration with the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Learning Curves and Error Analysis\n",
    "- **Plot Learning Curves:**\n",
    "  - Visualized training and validation loss and accuracy over epochs using `plt.plot()` to diagnose issues like overfitting or underfitting.\n",
    "  - Generated learning curve plots to assess model performance, convergence, and identify any trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Error Analysis:**\n",
    "  - Analyzed misclassified samples by collecting and examining examples where the model's predictions were incorrect.\n",
    "  - Investigated common characteristics of misclassified examples to identify potential improvements in preprocessing, feature engineering, or model architecture.\n"

    "# Exploratory Data Analysis 1: Summary statistics for numerical columns \n",
    "- This performs a summary statistics calculation on the selected numerical columns (the two columns \"Rating\" and \"Thumbs Up\".).\n",
    "- The output is a table with the following statistics for each column:\n",
    "     - count: The number of non-null values in each column.\n",
    "     - mean: The average value of the column.\n",
    "     - stddev: The standard deviation, which indicates how spread out the values are from the mean.\n",
    "     - min: The minimum value in the column.\n",
    "     - max: The maximum value in the column.\n",
    "- Explanation: \n",
    "1. Rating\n",
    "     - Count: 100,000 reviews have a rating value, indicating that there are no missing values in this column.\n",
    "     - Mean: The average rating is approximately 4.45. This suggests that, on average, users rate the app quite positively.\n",
    "     - Standard Deviation (stddev): The standard deviation is about 1.13. This measures the spread of ratings around the mean. A relatively high standard deviation indicates that there is considerable variability in the ratings.\n",
    "     - Minimum (min): The lowest rating is 1. This is the minimum value users have given.\n",
    "     - Maximum (max): The highest rating is 5. This is the maximum value users have given, indicating the highest possible rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Thumbs Up\n",
    "     - Count: 99,513 reviews have a Thumbs Up value. This indicates a small number of missing values (487) for this column, which should be handled in data preprocessing.\n",
    "     - Mean: The average number of thumbs up is approximately 0.66. This suggests that, on average, each review has a small number of thumbs up.\n",
    "     - Standard Deviation (stddev): The standard deviation is about 16.47. This is quite high, indicating that the number of thumbs up varies greatly between reviews. Some reviews might have very high counts, leading to a high spread.\n",
    "     - Minimum (min): The minimum value is 0, meaning some reviews might not have received any thumbs up.\n",
    "     - Maximum (max): The maximum number of thumbs up is 1,712. This is a very high value, suggesting that a small number of reviews received a large number of thumbs up, which significantly impacts the average and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Overall:\n",
    "- The average rating is quite high, suggesting positive user sentiment overall.\n",
    "- The variability in ratings (standard deviation) suggests that there is a wide range of opinions among users.\n",
    "- The mean number of thumbs up is low, but the high standard deviation and maximum value indicate that while most reviews receive few thumbs up, there are a few reviews with a very high number of thumbs up.\n"

    "- Title: 'Scatter Plot of Thumbs Up vs Rating\n",
    "- This indicates what the scatter plot is about: the relationship between the number of thumbs up and the rating given.\n",
    "- X-Axis: this axis represents the number of thumbs up a review received.\n",
    "- Y-Axis: This axis represents the rating given to the review.\n",
    "- Points (Markers): Each point on the scatter plot represents a review. The position of each point is determined by the number of thumbs up (x-coordinate) and the rating (y-coordinate) associated with that review.\n",
    "- Positive Correlation: If the points tend to rise from left to right, it suggests a positive correlation where higher numbers of thumbs up are associated with higher ratings.\n",
    "- No Correlation: If the points are scattered without any discernible pattern, it suggests that the number of thumbs up has little to no relationship with the rating.\n",
    "- Negative Correlation: If the points tend to fall from left to right, it suggests a negative correlation where higher numbers of thumbs up are associated with lower ratings.\n",
    "- Correlation between 'Thumbs Up' and 'Rating': -0.0103. This value is very close to zero, indicating that there is almost no linear relationship between the two variables\n",
    "- Near Zero: A correlation of -0.0103 is very close to zero, which suggests a very weak linear relationship between 'Thumbs Up' and 'Rating'. In practical terms, this means that changes in the number of 'Thumbs Up' do not have a meaningful impact on the rating, and vice versa.\n",
    "- No Linear Trend: Because the correlation is close to zero, there is no visible trend in the scatter plot. No line or curve that represents a strong relationship between 'Thumbs Up' and 'Rating'.\n",
    "- Scatter Density: There are some clusters of points, but these do not suggest a systematic relationship between the two variables."

    "- Title: \"Bar graph showing Number of Reviews per Rating\" \n",
    "- It indicates that the graph shows how many reviews are associated with each rating value.\n",
    "- X-Axis: This axis represents the different rating values assigned to reviews. Each tick on this axis corresponds to a specific rating value (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n",
    "- Y-Axis:  This axis shows the number of reviews that fall into each rating category. The height of each bar indicates how many reviews received that particular rating.\n",
    "- Bars: Each bar represents the count of reviews for a specific rating value. The height of each bar reflects the number of reviews that received that rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rating 1: 6,883 Reviews\n",
    "- Observation: This rating level has the lowest number of reviews compared to other ratings.\n",
    "- Implication: A relatively small number of users rated the app with the lowest score. This could suggest that the app had fewer users who experienced significant dissatisfaction, or that very negative experiences are less common.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Rating 2: 1,930 Reviews\n",
    "- Observation: This rating also has a low number of reviews, slightly more than Rating 1 but still relatively small.\n",
    "- Implication: Users giving a rating of 2 indicate dissatisfaction, but it is not as pronounced as Rating 1. The low count might reflect that users who had negative experiences were not very frequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Rating 3: 4,407 Reviews\n",
    "- Observation: The count for Rating 3 is moderate and falls in between the lower and higher end of the scale.\n",
    "- Implication: Rating 3 represents a neutral or mixed sentiment towards the app. It’s a middle-ground rating that shows a significant number of users had neither a strongly positive nor a strongly negative experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Rating 4: 12,377 Reviews\n",
    "- Observation: This rating has a substantial number of reviews, suggesting a higher level of user satisfaction compared to Ratings 1, 2, and 3.\n",
    "- Implication: Users who rated the app with a 4 likely had a positive experience but might have found some areas for improvement. This indicates a generally favorable view of the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Rating 5: 74,403 Reviews\n",
    "- Observation: Rating 5 has the highest number of reviews by a large margin.\n",
    "- Implication: This overwhelming number of reviews indicates that a significant portion of users were highly satisfied with the app. This could be due to exceptional performance, features, or overall user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The bar graph clearly shows that the majority of reviews are concentrated in the higher rating range, particularly Rating 5, which signifies a high level of user satisfaction. In contrast, the lower ratings (1 and 2) have fewer reviews, indicating less frequent dissatisfaction. The distribution highlights that while there are some negative experiences, the overall sentiment towards the app is quite positive, as evidenced by the high number of 5-star reviews. This visualization provides valuable insight into user sentiment and can be useful for understanding the overall reception of the app.\n"

    "- Title: \"Bar graph showing Top 10 App Versions by Number of Reviews\"\n",
    "- The title indicates that the graph is focused on the top 10 app versions with the highest number of reviews.\n",
    "- X-Axis: This axis represents different versions of the app. Each tick on this axis corresponds to one of the top 10 app versions by review count.\n",
    "- Y-Axis: This axis shows the number of reviews associated with each app version. The height of each bar corresponds to the total review count for each app version.\n",
    "- Bars: Each bar represents the total number of reviews for a specific app version. The height of each bar indicates how many reviews each app version has received.\n",
    "- The most frequent review category is labeled \"unknown,\" which could indicate missing or unrecorded app version information. This might be due to incomplete reviews.\n",
    "- The actual app versions show a descending trend in the number of reviews as you move down the list. This suggests that while some versions (like 1.2024.073) received a significant number of reviews, the number of reviews tends to decrease for older or less recent versions.\n",
    "- Newer versions of the app, such as those from the 1.2024 series, appear to have more reviews compared to older versions. This could indicate that users are more likely to review newer versions or that these versions were more actively used during the review period.\n",
    "- The distribution shows a significant number of reviews for a few versions, with a steep drop-off for others. This implies that while some versions are highly reviewed, many versions have relatively few reviews. This could reflect varying levels of user engagement or adoption rates across different versions.\n",
    "- Understanding which versions received the most reviews can help prioritize which versions to focus on for further analysis or improvements. For example, if certain versions are receiving disproportionate attention, it might be worth examining if those versions had specific issues or updates that attracted more feedback."

    "# Hyperparameter Combinations and Results\n",
    "- Combination 1:\n",
    "     - hidden_size: 150\n",
    "     - num_layers: 2\n",
    "     - learning_rate: 0.001\n",
    "     - dropout_rate: 0.2\n",
    "     - RNN Model Accuracy: 0.87\n",
    "     -LSTM Model Accuracy: 0.86\n",
    "     - For this combination, the RNN model achieved an accuracy of 0.87, while the LSTM model achieved 0.86. The RNN slightly outperformed the LSTM for this set of hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combination 2:\n",
    "     - hidden_size: 150\n",
    "     - num_layers: 1\n",
    "     - learning_rate: 0.001\n",
    "     - dropout_rate: 0.2\n",
    "     - RNN Model Accuracy: 0.87\n",
    "     - LSTM Model Accuracy: 0.88\n",
    "     - Here, the LSTM model performed slightly better than the RNN, achieving an accuracy of 0.88, compared to the RNN's 0.87. This combination seems to have provided better results for the LSTM model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combination 3:\n",
    "     - hidden_size: 100\n",
    "     - num_layers: 2\n",
    "     - learning_rate: 0.001\n",

    "     - RNN Model Accuracy: 0.86\n",
    "     - LSTM Model Accuracy: 0.87\n",
    "     - For this set, the LSTM model again outperformed the RNN model, achieving an accuracy of 0.87 compared to the RNN's 0.86.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combination 4:\n",
    "     - hidden_size: 150\n",
    "     - num_layers: 1\n",
    "     - learning_rate: 0.01\n",
    "     - dropout_rate: 0.5\n",
    "     - RNN Model Accuracy: 0.86\n",
    "     - LSTM Model Accuracy: 0.86\n",
    "     - Both models performed similarly here, with an accuracy of 0.86. The higher learning rate and dropout rate did not result in better performance compared to other combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combination 5:\n",
    "     - hidden_size: 50\n",
    "     - num_layers: 2\n",
    "     - learning_rate: 0.001\n",
    "     - dropout_rate: 0.2\n",
    "     - RNN Model Accuracy: 0.87\n",
    "     - LSTM Model Accuracy: 0.87\n",
    "     - Both models achieved the same accuracy of 0.87. Despite the smaller hidden size, the models still performed well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Summary\n",
    "     - Best Combination: The best hyperparameters were found to be:\n",
    "     - hidden_size: 150\n",
    "     - num_layers: 1\n",
    "     - learning_rate: 0.001\n",
    "     - dropout_rate: 0.2\n",
    "     - This combination resulted in the highest accuracy of 0.88 with the LSTM model, making it the most effective set of hyperparameters among those tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Observations\n",
    "- Model Performance: \n",
    "     - LSTM models generally performed slightly better than RNN models across the tested hyperparameter combinations. This may be due to LSTM's ability to better capture long-term dependencies in sequences.\n",
    "- Effect of Hyperparameters:\n",
    "     - Increasing hidden_size generally improved accuracy.\n",
    "     - A learning_rate of 0.001 was effective, while a higher learning rate of 0.01 did not improve performance.\n",
    "     - The dropout_rate had mixed effects, with a rate of 0.2 often being more favorable.\n",
    "- Early Stopping: \n",
    "     - Early stopping was used to prevent overfitting, but it was not triggered during training. This suggests that the models did not overfit within the number of epochs used.     "

    "# Learning curve graphs:\n",
    "1. Training and Validation Loss Graph:\n",
    "- X-axis (Epochs): Represents the number of complete passes through the entire training dataset. In this graph, it ranges from 1 to 10.\n",
    "- Y-axis (Loss): Indicates the loss value, which measures how well the model's predictions match the actual outcomes. Lower loss values generally indicate better performance.\n",
    "- Blue Line (Training Loss): Shows how the loss on the training dataset decreases over epochs. It typically decreases as the model learns from the data.\n",
    "- Red Line (Validation Loss): Displays the loss on the validation dataset. This helps in assessing how well the model generalizes to unseen data.\n",
    "- Explanation:\n",
    "     - Initial Decrease: The training loss decreases rapidly at first, indicating that the model is learning from the training data.\n",
    "     - Validation Loss Behavior: Initially decreases but may start to increase or plateau, which can indicate overfitting if it rises while training loss continues to decrease. In this graph, it slightly fluctuates, which could suggest minor overfitting or noise in validation data.\n",
    "     - Goal: Ideally, both training and validation loss should decrease, indicating the model is learning effectively and generalizing well.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Training and Validation Accuracy Graph:\n",
    "-  X-axis (Epochs): Similar to the loss graph, representing the number of epochs.\n",
    "- Y-axis (Accuracy): Reflects the proportion of correct predictions made by the model. Higher accuracy indicates better performance.\n",
    "- Blue Line (Training Accuracy): Shows the model's accuracy on the training dataset over epochs.\n",
    "- Red Line (Validation Accuracy): Indicates the model's accuracy on the validation dataset.\n",
    "- Explanation:\n",
    "     - Initial Increase: Both training and validation accuracy increase rapidly, showing that the model is learning to make better predictions.\n",
    "     - Training vs Validation Accuracy: If training accuracy continues to increase while validation accuracy plateaus or decreases, it may suggest overfitting. In this graph, validation accuracy reaches a plateau, indicating that the model might be at its generalization limit for the given data.\n",
    "     - Goal: Both accuracies should ideally increase and converge, indicating effective learning and good generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- These graphs are essential for diagnosing the learning process of RNNs/LSTMs and help in adjusting hyperparameters or employing techniques like regularization to improve model performance."
